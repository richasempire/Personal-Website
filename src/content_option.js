    aboutme: "Can there be another invention like Zero? This question has intrigued me since early in my career, leading me to dive into how emerging technologies could reshape life. In 2021, I joined a team exploring predictive healthcare planning and later co-founded a DAO focused on blockchain, metaverse, and XR technologies. Over time, I realized that inefficiencies in architecture consume over 40% of design time—time that could be better spent on creative work. My experiences drove me to explore how research and technology can not only spark thought but lead to actionable outcomes. I want to challenge the AEC industry to stop waiting for others to innovate on our behalf and instead integrate emerging tech to revolutionize workflows.",
